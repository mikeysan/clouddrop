# clouddrop
A Project that utilizes the iCloud API as well as Dropbox API to copy files across the two

### Some History (Background):

I recently realised that I would like to move my files from Dropbox to iCLoud.

### The problem:
I already have so many things on Dropbox. This leads to the idea that if they both have APIs, maybe I could use a Python script to transfer the files from Dropbox to iCloud.

### Current status:
What I have so far is a list of links discussing Dropbox and iCloud APIs with some basic tutorials on how to use them:

iCloud API: [pycloud api](https://github.com/picklepete/pyicloud)

Dropbox API and How-to: [How-to dropbox api](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-automate-the-storage-using-dropbox-api-in-python/)

Another how-to using Dropbox API: [Another dropbox how-to](https://practicaldatascience.co.uk/data-science/how-to-use-the-dropbox-api-with-python)

### The plan is:
- Get a basic understanding of how to use each API.
- Create a script that allows us to download files from Dropbox
- Create script that allows us to download files from iCloud
- Get those basic scripts working and then combine the methods to download from one host to the other
- Improve where possible
